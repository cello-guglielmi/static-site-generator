# The Tale of Sir Boots

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

This is a *simple* paragraph with some **bold** text and some *italics*.

Here's a [link to my cave](https://boots-cave.com) and some `inline code`.

### Daily Tasks

1. Wake up
2. Catch fish
3. Practice magic
4. Take a nap

> Sometimes the best magic is a good nap
> - Sir Boots

```python
def greet_wizard():
    print("Hello, magical friend!")
    return "sparkles"
```

#### Final *Thoughts*

This should test:

* Headers (multiple levels)
* Paragraph text
* **Bold** and *italic* text
* Links and inline code
* Unordered lists
* Ordered lists
* Block quotes
